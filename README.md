# find-primes
A simple Java based approach to enumerating all primes within a given range, using a LinkedList<br />
A natural number greater than 1 can either be prime, or the product of primes. This program determines if each number within the range is prime by
iterating through a linked list of primes to check if a previously determined prime divides it. If no primes divide it, the number gets added to the
end of the list and printed.
